A symbolic model checker for [Dynamic Epistemic Logic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dynamic-epistemic).


## How to use SMCDEL online

You can try SMCDEL online here: https://w4eg.de/malvin/illc/smcdelweb/


## How to run SMCDEL locally

1) Download binaries from the [latest release](https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL/releases)
   *or* compile from source using [stack](https://www.stackage.org).

- `stack install` will build and install an executable `smcdel`
  into `~/.local/bin` which should be in your `PATH` variable.

2) Create a text file `MuddyShort.smcdel.txt` which describes the knowledge structure and the formulas you want to check for truth or validity:

    ```
    -- Three Muddy Children in SMCDEL
    VARS 1,2,3
    LAW  Top
    OBS  alice: 2,3
         bob:   1,3
         carol: 1,2
    WHERE?
      [ ! (1|2|3) ] alice knows whether 1
    VALID?
      [ ! (1|2|3) ]
      [ ! ((~ (alice knows whether 1)) & (~ (bob knows whether 2)) & (~ (carol knows whether 3))) ]
      [ ! ((~ (alice knows whether 1)) & (~ (bob knows whether 2)) & (~ (carol knows whether 3))) ]
      (alice,bob,carol) comknow that (1 & 2 & 3)
    ```

3) Run `smcdel MuddyShort.smcdel.txt` resulting in:

    ```
    >> smcdel MuddyShort.smcdel.txt
    SMCDEL 1.0 by Malvin Gattinger -- https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL

    At which states is ... true?
    []
    [1]

    Is ... valid on the given structure?
    True
    ```

    More example files are in the folder [Examples](https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL/tree/master/Examples).

4) To also build and install the web interface, run `stack install --flag smcdel:web`
   Then you can run `smcdel-web` and open <http://localhost:3000>.

## Input Format

The first part of the input describes a *knowledge structure* (that encodes an S5 Kripke model).
With three keywords in this order:

```
VARS ...

LAW ...

OBS ...
```

- `VARS` is the keyword before the *vocabulary*, i.e. the set of all atomic propositions.
  For example, `VARS 0,1` says that in this structure we have two atomic propositions.
  One might usually call them "p" and "q", but in SMCDEL all variables must be integers.

- `LAW` is the keyword before the *state law*.
  This is a Boolean formula to say what states should exist.
  For example, `LAW Top` says that all possible states should be there.
  With `VARS 0,1` this we have four states `{}`, `{0}`, `{1}` and `{0,1}`.
  Alternatively, `LAW 1 | 2` would restrict this to three states `{0}`, `{1}` and `{0,1}`.
  All variables used in this formula must be mentioned in `VARS`.
  The state law is common knowledge among all agents.

- `OBS` is the keyword before the *observations*.
  Here we say which agent observes which of the atomic propositions.
  For example, `alice : 1,2` says that `alice` observes variables 1 and 2.
  All variables mentioned in `OBS` must be in `VARS`.
  All agents mentioned in the queries below must be included in the observation list here.

The second part of the input then consists of any number of *queries*, each using one of the three keywords:

- `VALID?` followed by a formula will check whether the formula is valid in the structure, i.e. true at all states.

  Example: `VALID? alice knows that 0`.

- `WHERE?` followed by a formula will list all the states where the formula is true.

  Example: `WHERE? bob knows whether 1`.

- `TRUE?` followed by a state and a formula will check if the formula is true at that state.

  Example: `TRUE? {0,1} alice knows that 0`

The syntax for formulas is defined in `src/SMCDEL/Internal/Lex.x` and `src/SMCDEL/Internal/Parse.y`. 

## Advanced usage

The executables only provide model checking for S5 with public announcements.
For K and to define more complex models and updates, SMCDEL should be used as a Haskell library.
Please refer to the [Haddock documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/smcdel) for each module.

Examples can be found in the folders
  [src/SMCDEL/Examples](https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL/tree/master/src/SMCDEL/Examples)
and
  [bench](https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL/tree/master/bench).

*Dependencies*:
To get all visualisation functions working, [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/), [dot2tex](https://github.com/kjellmf/dot2tex) and some LaTeX packages should be installed.
On Debian, please do `sudo apt install graphviz dot2tex libtinfo5 texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra poppler-utils preview-latex-style texlive-pstricks zlib1g-dev`.


## Used BDD packages

SMCDEL uses different [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram) packages.

- [Data.HasCacBDD](https://github.com/m4lvin/HasCacBDD) which runs CacBDD from <http://kailesu.net/CacBDD/>.
  This is the default choice used by the executables and the modules `SMCDEL.Symbolic.S5` and `SMCDEL.Symbolic.K`.

- The pure Haskell library [`decision-diagrams`](https://github.com/msakai/haskell-decision-diagrams).
  It is used by the module `SMCDEL.Symbolic.S5_DD`.

- Optionally, [Cudd](https://github.com/davidcock/cudd) ([with some patches](https://github.com/m4lvin/cudd))
  which uses the CUDD library.
  To obtain the modules `SMCDEL.Symbolic.K_CUDD`, `SMCDEL.Symbolic.Ki_CUDD` and `SMCDEL.Symbolic.S5_CUDD`
  you should compile with `stack build --flag smcdel:with-cudd`.
